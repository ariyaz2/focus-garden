# Focus Garden ðŸŒ¿  
**Alina Riyaz, Spring 2025**

Focus Garden is a simple, open-source focus and mood tracking project. It helps individuals log their daily focus level and mood on a scale of 1â€“5, along with short journal reflections. The goal is to help people stay mindful of their routines and energy, while building a "garden" of consistent effort over time.

This project is solo-friendly, beginner-friendly, and fully transparent. It uses basic Markdown, a CSV file for tracking, and GitHub tools like issues and project boards. The Focus Garden can grow with contributors who want to add features like visual summaries, templates, or automation.

This project demonstrates the core principles of working open: transparency, documentation, sustainability, and collaboration.
