# Open Canvas – Focus Garden 🌿

## Purpose
Focus Garden is a lightweight, open-source productivity tracker designed to help individuals build consistent daily habits by tracking their focus, mood, and short reflections. It aims to support mindfulness and intentional routines.

## Outcome
The primary outcome is a simple CSV tracker and journaling system that can be used by anyone looking to improve their focus and self-awareness. Over time, users “grow their garden” by consistently checking in with themselves.

## Process
The project uses GitHub for open collaboration. Features are tracked using a project board and GitHub issues. Documentation, templates, and contribution guidelines will help onboard collaborators. The project follows “working open” practices by being transparent, modular, and sustainable.
